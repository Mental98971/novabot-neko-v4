"""
Force-subscribe middleware — require joining settings.force_sub_channel
before using the bot.

Registered as its own MessageHandler in the same handler group as
access_control_middleware (group=-4), added immediately after it, so
bans/blacklist/maintenance still take priority — a banned user
shouldn't get a join prompt at all — while everything downstream
(logging, antiflood, antispam, and every plugin) still runs after both.

Design notes:
  - Fails OPEN, not closed: if the membership check itself errors (bot
    not an admin of the channel, channel doesn't exist, transient
    Telegram API error), the user is let through rather than the whole
    bot becoming unusable for everyone because of a misconfigured
    channel. A hard "no" from Telegram (user genuinely not a member) is
    the only thing that blocks.
  - Cached per user for force_sub_cache_seconds so normal chatting
    doesn't hit getChatMember on every single message.
  - Only intercepts Message-type updates (see registration in
    bot/core/bot.py) — CallbackQueryHandler-based buttons, including
    this module's own "Check Again" button, are a separate PTB update
    type and are never blocked by this middleware, so the button always
    works even for a user this same middleware is currently blocking.
  - Sudo/owner bypass, matching every other bot-wide gate in this
    codebase (maintenance mode, private_bot_mode, global bans).
