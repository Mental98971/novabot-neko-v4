"""Base plugin architecture.

If you want to add more chaos, inherit from Plugin.

Improvements over the original:
  - ``PluginResult.metadata`` uses ``field(default_factory=dict)`` instead
    of the ``None``-then-``__post_init__`` pattern. Cleaner, no boilerplate.
  - ``Plugin.triggers`` is a tuple (immutable) instead of a list, preventing
    the shared-mutable-default footgun.
  - ``PluginManager.route`` replaces the broken two-pass threshold system
    with a single-pass weighted scorer. The original's second pass was dead
    code — all plugins' low-confidence returns failed the ``> 0.7`` gate.
    Now every plugin is called once, scored with an intent-match boost, and
    the highest-scoring result wins.
  - ``contains_word``/``load_skin_json`` are shared here so every subplugin
    uses the same word-boundary matching and skin-loading fallback instead
    of four slightly-different copies of the same logic.
