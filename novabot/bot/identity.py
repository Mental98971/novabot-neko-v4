"""
Bot identity & branding — single source of truth for the user-facing
name, username, and owner display.

To rebrand every user-facing surface at once (/start, /help, error
messages, personality responses, collector messages, music messages,
group-management messages, ...), change BOT_DISPLAY_NAME /
BOT_DISPLAY_USERNAME / BOT_OWNER_NAME in .env — see bot/config.py.
Nothing here needs editing for a routine rebrand; this module just
exposes those settings as small helpers so call sites don't reach into
`settings` directly for display strings, and documents the history.

Historical note — internal only, not shown to users
----------------------------------------------------
This codebase, its Python package name (`bot`), database tables,
Docker image, environment variable names, internal log fields, and
command-prefix conventions (e.g. the personality layer's `/nnr_*`
commands, short for its original "Nanora" codename) all still say
"novabot" / "nanora" internally. That's intentional, not an oversight:
renaming the underlying package, imports, class names, or database
schema would break every existing deployment, .env file, and database
for zero user-facing benefit — see the project's own README for why
`_auto_migrate()` and similar exist specifically to avoid destructive
renames. Only the *displayed* identity changed. See BOT_HISTORY below.

Do not "clean up" the internal names to match the current display name;
do not let the internal names leak into anything a Telegram user reads.
